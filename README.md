Task: Find the Factorial coding challenge

Write a program that allows a user to enter a number, and then calculate the factorial of that number
and print it on screen. Your program should accept and validate user input, find the factorial, and print
the answer.

Expectations:
Write your code in Angular.
Handle any exception conditions appropriately.
Include a set of unit tests.
Use any tool you want to write the code and return it in a separate file that can be read in
Notepad, Word, or Visual Studio.
Code and unit tests should be runnable.

# UlTest Angular Project

The task was completed as described.
An autofocus was added to the number input field.
Form Validation and error messages are displayed.
Unit tests are written to test the validation and the factorial function.
Minor styling using AirBnb OOCSS style (scss)
Routing is added
Shared module which holds shared components is demonstrated (shared/form.component)
Code is commented

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
